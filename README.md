<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>C++ decision-making statements control the flow of a program based on specific conditions. The `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is true. The `else if` and `else` statements provide additional conditions and alternative code blocks. The `switch` statement allows multi-way branching based on the value of a variable. These constructs enable dynamic, flexible, and efficient control over program execution.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion,through this experiment we have learnt how to use C++ decision making statements. We have written and successfully executed the code for various program implementing C++ decision making statements.</p>
